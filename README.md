# Simple Weapon Holster System

An immersive FiveM script for QBCore framework that displays visible weapons holstered on player characters.

## Overview

This script enhances roleplay realism by displaying holstered weapons on players instead of having them magically disappear when not equipped. When players switch weapons, the previous weapon is visibly attached to the character model in a realistic position.

## Features

- Realistic weapon holstering on character body
- Permission-based system (admin only option, job restrictions)
- Weapon visibility synced across all players
- Configurable options for server administrators

## Dependencies

- QBCore Framework

## Installation

1. Download the resource
2. Extract it to your server's resources folder
3. Add `ensure omiya-weaponcarry` to your server.cfg
4. Restart your server or start the resource manually

## Configuration

Configuration can be managed through the `server.lua` file:

```lua
local Config = {
    AdminOnly = false,       -- Set to true to restrict usage to admins only
    EnabledJobs = {},        -- Empty means all jobs can use it, or specify like {'police', 'sheriff'}
    VersionCheck = true      -- Check for updates
}
```

### Options:

- **AdminOnly**: When set to `true`, only server administrators can use the holster system
- **EnabledJobs**: Specify which jobs can use the holster system (empty array allows all jobs)
- **VersionCheck**: Enable/disable update checking

## Commands

| Command | Description | Permission |
|---------|-------------|------------|

- Admin status
